export function Calendar() {

    return (
        <div className="calendar-page" >

            <div className="page-text">
                <h1>
                    Welcome to the calendar page!
                </h1>

                <p>You know.. this is awkward because
                    this page isn't implemented yet.
                    The plan was to have this page
                    display a calendar view 
                    of the events or a timeline
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
